# From my experience on macOS, different editors seem to treat leading differently:

# - others seem to react to changing leading in steps (e.g. Xcode, where nothing happens until it crosses a
#   certain threshold where it suddenly becomes way tighter or way more relaxed).
# Leading also affects how text selection is rendered (too much leading -> text sits too on low in selection background).
# This value seemed a decent compromise for the set of apps I'm using and my preferences, YMMV.
